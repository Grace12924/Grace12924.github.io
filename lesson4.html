  <h1>The Trinity – God the Father</h1>
  <hr>
  <h4>God the Father is the beginning of everything. He spoke, and creation existed. He formed humanity in His image and gave life meaning. God isn’t distant—He’s personal, powerful, and deeply involved in the world He made. To understand Him is to understand where everything begins.</h4>

  <div class="high-banner"><h4>1. God the Creator</h4></div>
  <h4>God created everything with purpose. Nothing exists by chance. Every person, every piece of creation, shows His design and authority. The universe isn’t random—it’s ordered by the same God who holds it all together.</h4>
  <h5>Genesis 1:1 — “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”</h5>

  <div class="high-banner"><h4>2. The Father's Authority</h4></div>
  <h4>God is in control of everything. His power has no limits, and His will stands forever. People and nations rise and fall, but His Word never changes. Trusting Him means learning to rest in His control instead of our own.</h4>
  <h5>Psalm 115:3 — “Our God is in heaven; He does whatever pleases Him.”</h5>

  <div class="high-banner"><h4>3. The Father's Love</h4></div>
  <h4>God’s power is matched by His love. He calls us His children, not servants or strangers. His love isn’t based on what we do—it’s who He is. Even when people turn away, He keeps reaching out with patience and mercy.</h4>
  <h5>1 John 3:1 — “See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God.”</h5>

  <div class="high-banner"><h4>4. God the Provider</h4></div>
  <h4>God takes care of His people. He provides not just for our physical needs, but also for our strength, peace, and purpose. When we put Him first, everything else falls into its right place.</h4>
  <h5>Matthew 6:33 — “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.”</h5>

  <div class="high-banner"><h4>5. Living Under His Rule</h4></div>
  <h4>Knowing God the Father changes how we live. He deserves our obedience, not out of fear, but because He is worthy of it. When we live under His rule, we find direction, security, and peace that can’t come from anywhere else.</h4>
