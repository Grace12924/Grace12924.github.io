    <h1>What Does It Mean to Be a Christian?</h1>
    <hr>
    <h4>Being a Christian is far beyond just attending church or praying. It means your life is transformed, through the glory, power, and grace. Lets explore 5 key truths that define what it means to be a follower of Jesus Christ.</h4>
    <hr>
    <div class="high-banner"><h4>1. Belief in Jesus Christ</h4></div>
    <h4>As shown in the title, Christians are expected to believe in Jesus Christ. Jesus is the Son of God who came down to earth and dies for our sins. This is the foundation that shapes Christian faith.</h4>
    <h5>John 3:16 tells us,
“For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</h5>
<div class="high-banner"><h4>2. Following Jesus</h4></div>
<h4>Belief must be followed by action. Being a Christian means becoming a disciple of Jesus—learning from Him and striving to live like Him.</h4>
<h4>To follow Jesus means to:</h4>
<h5>Love others, even our enemies (John 13:34)</h5>
<h5>Forgive, just as we’ve been forgiven (Matthew 6:14-15)</h5>
<h5>Serve the needy, reflecting God’s compassion (Matthew 25:35-40)</h5>
<h5>Live humbly and faithfully, walking in obedience (Micah 6:8)</h5>
<h4>Following Jesus is a daily choice. It's not about perfection, but about direction—choosing to walk in the steps of Christ.</h4>

<div class="high-banner"><h4>3. Saved by Grace, Not Works</h4></div>
<h4>One of the core truths of Christianity is that salvation is not earned by our good deeds but given freely through God’s grace. No amount of effort or moral behavior can make us right with God on our own.</h4>
<h5>Ephesians 2:8-9 (NIV) says:<br>
“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.”</h5>
<h4>This means Christians do good not to be saved, but because they are saved. Our actions are a response to God’s love, not a way to earn it.</h4>

<div class="high-banner"><h4>4. A New Life in Christ</h4></div>
<h4>Becoming a Christian leads to inner transformation. The Holy Spirit enters the believer and begins to change the heart, desires, and priorities. Sin no longer sits comfortably in the heart of a Christian.</h4>
<h4>When a Christian sins and doesn’t seek forgiveness, they may feel distant from God or burdened with guilt—a sign that their heart is still sensitive to sin. This conviction is actually evidence of God's work in them.</h4>
<h5>Galatians 5:22-23 (NIV) describes the “fruit” of a life led by the Spirit:<br>
“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.”</h5>
<h4>These qualities don’t appear overnight, but over time, a true Christian will grow in godly character.</h4>

<div class="high-banner"><h4>5. A Daily Relationship with God</h4></div>
<h4>Christianity is not just a religion—it’s a relationship. God desires to walk with His people every day, not just be acknowledged on Sundays.</h4>
<h4>This relationship involves:</h4>
<h5>Prayer – speaking and listening to God</h5>
<h5>Bible study – learning God’s truth and will</h5>
<h5>Worship – expressing love and reverence to God</h5>
<h5>Obedience – living in a way that pleases Him</h5>
<h4>As with any close relationship, consistency matters. A Christian’s faith is nurtured through daily time with God and grows deeper through life’s highs and lows.</h4>
