    <h1>The Trinity – Jesus</h1>
    <hr>
    <h4>Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the second Person of the Trinity. He is fully God in human form, and through His life, death, and resurrection, we see God’s love in action. He is the only way to God the Father and the source of eternal life.</h4>
    <hr>
    
    <div class="high-banner"><h4>1. He Is God in Human Form</h4></div>
    <h4>Jesus is not just a great teacher or prophet. He is God Himself, taking on human form to live among us. Through His words, actions, and miracles, we see God revealed in a way we can understand.</h4>
    <h5>John 1:1,14: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God…The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.”</h5>
    
    <div class="high-banner"><h4>2. Jesus Came to Save</h4></div>
    <h4>Jesus came to rescue humanity from sin. His death on the cross and resurrection make forgiveness possible. He is the only way to be reconciled with God and receive eternal life.</h4>
    <h5>John 14:6: “Jesus answered, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’”</h5>
    
    <div class="high-banner"><h4>3. God Revealed Through Him</h4></div>
    <h4>Through Jesus, we see the Father’s heart. His teachings, example, and love reveal what God is truly like and how we are called to live.</h4>
    <h5>John 14:9: “Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.”</h5>
    
    <div class="high-banner"><h4>4. The Savior Gives Strength</h4></div>
    <h4>Because Jesus rose from the dead, believers receive new life and the power to live faithfully. He walks with us, gives guidance, and strengthens us through every challenge.</h4>
    <h5>Matthew 28:18-20: “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations…And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”</h5>
    
    <div class="high-banner"><h4>5. Walking With Him</h4></div>
    <h4>Jesus is alive today. Following Him isn’t about rules or religion—it’s about trusting Him, learning from Him, and letting His love shape every part of your life. He is the way, the truth, and the life, and He never leaves those who follow Him.</h4>
